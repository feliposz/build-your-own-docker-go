# Build Your Own Docker

This is my solution in Go for the
["Build Your Own Docker" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/docker).

**Note**: Head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge yourself.

# Running tests locally

To run tests locally (linux only!), the following need to be built and installed accordingly:

- [docker-tester](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-tester/)
- [docker-explorer](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-explorer)
